# DynamicStarModel
 A dynamic star model

This star model includes a base color and a secondary, moving color as well as a corona and halo effect.  In the image below the base color is red and the moving color is yellow.

In the second image you can see a coronal mass ejection effect.

All the effects are dynamic.

By adding access to star data (a ScriptableObject) one could specify a color scheme based on the star's spectral type and luminosity class.

In addition, multiple stars can be placed and warp lines (work in progress) can be drawn from stars within a certain distance.
